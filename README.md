# Udacity_Investigate_A_Dataset_Project
This project was the first project I completed while undertaking Udacity's Data Analyst Program
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing 10,000+ movies listed on The Movie Database (TMDb).
The dataset was originally obtained from the renowned Kaggle website which also serves as an open or public data source.
## Installation
If you are using Jupyter Notebook like I did, you will need to install Anaconda software and import the following packages:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib.pyplot

seaborn

%matplotlib inline (this just needs to be included, not imported)
